      We are a neighborhood jeweler and and we pride ourselves on our referral
      business. It is our priority to exceed expectations and to provide
      exceptional personalized service to every customer. We are so fortunate to
      say that our customers become like family, and that our customers also
      entrust us with their own friends and families when they send them to us.
      Joe Boiadjian bought Yale Jewelers in 2005 after spending 30 years on the
      wholesale side of the jewelry business and he very much enjoys and values
      the face to face interaction and connection with his loyal customers and
      new-comers alike.

  Custom re-design of your existing pieces or restoration of your antique
  jewelry and watches is a passion of ours! Bring the pieces that you no longer
  wear or would like to make changes to, and we will take great care to
  transform your old or inherited jewelry into your new favorite pieces that
  express who you are today, while retaining their sentimentality and memories.
</p>
<p>
  Or if you would like to fully <i>restore</i> your antique pieces instead, we
  work with our own specialists that share our enthusiasm and respect for the
  older treasures to restore them to their former glory so they can be worn and
  enjoyed for many years to come.
</p>
<p>
  And finally if there is design idea or vision that you would like to see come
  to lifeâ€¦we relish in the opportunity to help make that dream into a reality
  with a custom designed piece, made just for you!
