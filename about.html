<p>
    Owned by Joe Boiadjian, Yale Jewelers has been serving Santa Monica since 1978. Yale's philosophy is simple; find something
    that speaks to you! It should fit who you are, your personality, your style...
</p>
<p>
    Joe has been in the jewelry business for over 20 years. He started his career working in wholesale in Downtown Los Angeles
    after finishing school at the GIA. As he built a successful wholesale business, he realized that something was missing.
    The people. Specifically, the look on someone's face when they find exactly what they were searching for.
</p>
<p>
    Joe realized he was tired and unfulfilled doing wholesale; he wanted to work directly with the customers. He wanted to be
    the one to help them find their perfect piece of jewelry. He loves the art of creating a custom piece, inspired by the
    client's desire.

<p>
    Our main goal at Yale is not only to provide our customers with beautiful jewelry, but to provide incredible service. From
    start to finish, Yale will be there for you. We are truly passionate about what we do. Please visit us to experience
    the difference!
